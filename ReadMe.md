**Thrift#** is an implementation of the Thrift protocol for .NET.

Unlike Apache's Thrift implementation, it does not use a compiler or separate Thrift interface definition files; everything is done using attributes.
This allows complete freedom over the types, and enables interesting features such as converters.
