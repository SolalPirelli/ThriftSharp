**Thrift#** is a Thrift client library for .NET.

Unlike the official Thrift client, it does not use a compiler or separate Thrift interface definition files; everything is done using attributes. This allows complete freedom over the names of the types, and enables interesting features such as converters.

If you need something that Thrift# doesn't offer (e.g. protocols, transports), feel free to open an issue for it, or even code it yourself if you know how to.
